# Quote of the day using traditional unix fortune command

Just some of my favourite quotes and reminders of keyboard shortcuts or
commands on my system including those I've written myself.

## Prerequisites

* `make`
* `fortune`

## Building

```console
make
```

## Usage

> fortune _path-to-this-dir_

## Adding and Modifying

Create or edit files with names of your own choosing. Add text of your own
quotes, formatted multiple lines are ok, each entry must be prefixed by a `%`
character on its own line.
