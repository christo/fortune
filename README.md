# Quote of the day using traditional unix fortune command

Just some of my favourite quotes and reminders of keyboard shortcuts or
commands on my system including those I've written myself.

I have found this a useful replacement of certain kinds of notes 
for learning keybindings or command line programs I've made or installed.

## Prerequisites

* `make`
* `fortune`

## Building

```console
$ make
```

## Usage

> fortune _path-to-this-dir_

## Categories

The categories of fortune cookies are as follows:

christo : my own programs and aliases
cs-quotes : quotes I like from computer science
neovim : tips on using neovim
programs : various programs I have installed
radar : misc things I want to be reminded of
sh : command-line antics
stickers : something you might find as a laptop sticker
strategies: personal productivity methods
tmux : tmux-specific reminders; mostly keybindings
wisdom : general wisdom for life
zoomer : shit zoomers say

## Adding and Modifying

Create or edit files with names of your own choosing. Add text of your own
quotes, formatted multiple lines are ok, each entry must be separated by a `%`
character on its own line.
